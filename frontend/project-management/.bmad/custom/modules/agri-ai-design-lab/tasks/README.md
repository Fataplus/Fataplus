# Agri-AI Design Lab Tasks

Task library supporting connectors and automations:

- `figma-sync.xml` – configure Figma token sync and design system export.
- `nocode-deploy.xml` – orchestrate Bubble/FlutterFlow deployment hooks.
- `notion-sync.xml` – publish playbooks to Notion workspace.
- `twilio-setup.xml` – prepare SMS pilot infrastructure.

Add additional XML task definitions as integrations mature (e.g., design token converters, translation helpers).
