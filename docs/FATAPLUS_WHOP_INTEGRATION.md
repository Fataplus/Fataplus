# Fataplus x Whop Integration – Technical Plan & Roadmap

## Vision

Fataplus will become a modern, maintainable, and scalable platform by:
- Using Whop for authentication, memberships, payments, messaging, and company management.
- Keeping Fataplus as a “thin” UI/orchestration layer (Nuxt 3, NuxtHub, Vue 3, TypeScript).
- Retaining and expanding Fataplus’s unique AI features (Nuxt AI, custom endpoints, RAG, etc.).
- Applying Fataplus branding (colors, themes) to Whop’s design system components for a seamless user experience.

## What We Plan To Do

### 1. UI/UX
- Use Whop’s design system components (storybook.whop.dev) as the base for all UI.
- Override colors, fonts, and themes to match Fataplus branding (fata.plus).
- Ensure all UI is accessible, responsive, and supports dark/light mode and multi-language.

### 2. Business Logic
- Delegate authentication, memberships, payments, messaging, and company/org management to Whop via API/SDK.
- Remove or proxy all local implementations of these features in Fataplus.

### 3. AI Features
- Keep all Fataplus AI endpoints and logic (Nuxt AI, server/api/ai/*, etc.).
- Use NuxtHub for scalable, edge/serverless AI deployment.
- Orchestrate workflows between Whop (user, membership, payment data) and Fataplus AI (recommendations, chat, learning, etc.).

### 4. Integration
- Use Whop SDK (`@whop-apps/sdk`) and GraphQL API for all user, product, and payment operations.
- Use webhooks for payment/membership events.
- Use Nuxt server routes for AI, custom content, and orchestration.
- Use Pinia only for minimal local state (UI, session, etc.).

### 5. Branding
- Override Whop design system tokens (colors, fonts, etc.) with Fataplus palette in Tailwind config and/or CSS variables.
- Document and test all customizations.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Audit & Planning
- [ ] List all Fataplus features that overlap with Whop.
- [ ] Identify which features to remove, proxy, or keep.
- [ ] Audit current UI components and map to Whop design system equivalents.

### Phase 2: Integration Foundation
- [ ] Install Whop SDK (`npm install @whop-apps/sdk`).
- [ ] Configure environment variables for Whop integration.
- [ ] Set up authentication via Whop OAuth/token validation.
- [ ] Set up API calls to Whop for user, product, payment, and messaging.

### Phase 3: UI Refactor
- [ ] Replace local UI components with Whop design system components.
- [ ] Apply Fataplus branding (colors, fonts, themes) to Whop components.
- [ ] Ensure accessibility, responsiveness, and multi-language support.

### Phase 4: Business Logic Refactor
- [ ] Remove/proxy local implementations of memberships, payments, messaging, etc.
- [ ] Use Whop webhooks for payment/membership events.
- [ ] Refactor Pinia stores to only manage local UI/session state.

### Phase 5: AI & Orchestration
- [ ] Keep and expand Fataplus AI endpoints (Nuxt AI, server/api/ai/*).
- [ ] Integrate Whop data into AI workflows (personalization, recommendations, etc.).
- [ ] Test AI endpoints on NuxtHub (edge/serverless).

### Phase 6: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Test all user flows (auth, access, payment, messaging, AI).
- [ ] Document integration patterns, customizations, and onboarding steps.
- [ ] Monitor performance and user experience.

### Phase 7: Launch & Iterate
- [ ] Deploy to NuxtHub.
- [ ] Monitor, collect feedback, and iterate on UI/UX and AI features.

## Notes

- Fataplus will be a “light” UI/orchestration layer, but will keep all unique AI and content features.
- Whop will handle all heavy business logic (auth, payments, memberships, messaging).
- All UI will use Whop’s design system, but with Fataplus branding.
- AI endpoints will be deployed and scaled via NuxtHub, and can use Whop data for personalization.
