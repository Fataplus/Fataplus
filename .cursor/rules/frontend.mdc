- Use Nuxt 3, Nuxt-UI,  Vue 3, and TypeScript for all frontend code. 
- Organize code by feature: group related components, composables, and stores.
- Use file-based routing and composables for logic reuse.
- All UI must be responsive, accessible (WCAG), and support dark/light mode.
- Support multi-language (FR/MG minimum) using Nuxt i18n.
- Use Pinia for state management.
- Integrate with backend APIs via composables/services.
- Use ESLint and Prettier for linting and formatting.
- Prioritize modular, testable, and maintainable code.
- Follow Fataplus branding and UX guidelines: clear navigation, feedback, gamification, and onboarding.
- Integrate with external services (Dolibarr, Nextcloud, DocuSeal, etc.) via API.
- All user input must be validated on the client side.
