## 🎯 Design Challenge

Fataplus, currently operating as a Malagasy design-first agritech studio with an "open blueprint catalog," needs to evolve into a world-class product design agency that demonstrates expertise at the intersection of AI and Agritech. The challenge is to leverage existing technical foundations (Nuxt 3, TypeScript, AI integration) and marketplace/learning platform achievements to create a compelling agency presence that attracts clients seeking innovative digital solutions in agriculture and AI-driven product design.

**Primary stakeholders:** Malagasy farmers, agricultural enterprises, tech startups, and international organizations seeking sustainable agribusiness solutions across Madagascar and Africa.

**Success definition:** Established as the go-to product design agency for AI-powered agricultural solutions, with measurable impact on SDG 2, 8, and 12, while showcasing scalable design systems that enable sustainable agribusiness growth.
