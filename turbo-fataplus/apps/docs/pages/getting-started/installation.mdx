# Installation

This guide will help you set up FataPlus on your local machine for development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or later)
- **npm** (v10 or later)
- **Git**

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fataplus/Fataplus.git
cd Fataplus
```

## Install Dependencies

FataPlus uses Turborepo to manage the monorepo structure. Install all dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install dependencies for all packages and applications in the monorepo.

## Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the `apps/web` directory:

```bash
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
```

Then, update the environment variables with your own values:

```
VITE_POCKETBASE_URL=https://your-pocketbase-url.com
```

## Start the Development Server

To start the development server for all applications:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- The web application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- The documentation site at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## Build for Production
