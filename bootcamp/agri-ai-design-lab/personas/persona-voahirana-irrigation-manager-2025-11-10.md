# Persona Snapshot: Voahirana Randria

**Segment:** Cooperative Irrigation Scheduler
**Location / Context:** Andilamena cooperative, Alaotra-Mangoro
**Created:** 2025-11-10

## Story
Voahirana coordinates watering schedules for 65 rice farmers, balancing limited pump availability and seasonal rains. She juggles paper logs, WhatsApp messages, and weekly meetings to prevent crop stress.

## Jobs-to-be-Done
- Primary JTBD: Ensure equitable irrigation slots so every farmer receives water at the optimal time.
- Secondary JTBD: Report water usage and crop status to MAEP and donors.

## Pains & Gains
| Pains | Gains |
| --- | --- |
| Manual scheduling causes conflicts; forecasts unreliable; lacks visibility into pump downtime | Wants predictive guidance, automated alerts, and proof of impact |

## Tech & Channel Preferences
- Devices & connectivity: Android phone with intermittent 3G; cooperative laptop shared once a week.
- Trust anchors & influencers: Relies on agronomist from FOFIFA and cooperative elders for decisions.

## Opportunities
- AI/UX opportunities: Dashboard highlighting upcoming stress periods, SMS alerts for schedule changes, offline-ready forms.
- Validation partners: Lova (cooperative champion), FOFIFA agronomists, MAEP regional office.

## Next Actions
Plan co-design workshop with Voahirana to test scheduling flows and offline-first prototypes.
