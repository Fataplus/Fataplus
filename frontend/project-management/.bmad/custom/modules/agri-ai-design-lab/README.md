Version: 0.1.0

Agri-AI Design Lab packages Fataplus' agritech product design practice into a BMAD module. It blends ethnographic research synthesis, AI opportunity framing, UX/UI + front-end prototyping, no-code acceleration, and CX/DX rollout planning. The module can operate for client engagements or switch into bootcamp training mode for the 2026 Figma program.

- **Feature Workflows:** personas, service blueprints, no-code sprint mapping, CX journey mapping, impact pitch kits.
- **Utility Workflows:** research asset ingestion, playbook export, bootcamp mode toggle.

## Usage Modes

1. **Client Delivery:** Generate venture-grade agritech product playbooks, Figma systems, and no-code implementation briefs.
2. **Bootcamp Training:** Provide structured prompts, lesson modules, and rubric feedback for cohorts practicing real agritech briefs.

## Installation Notes
