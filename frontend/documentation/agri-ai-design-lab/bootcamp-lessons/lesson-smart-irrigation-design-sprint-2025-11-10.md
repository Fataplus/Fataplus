## Assessment Rubric
| Criteria | Beginner | Proficient | Expert |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Insight-to-concept alignment | Lists ideas without evidence | Connects concepts to insights with basic rationale | Demonstrates strong evidence mapping, handles tradeoffs |
| UX flow quality | Linear screens, missing edge cases | Covers main flow with some edge handling | Delivers inclusive, offline-aware flow with micro-interactions |
| No-code feasibility | Generic description | Basic component mapping | Detailed component + data mapping with automation plan |
| Communication | Single language, limited clarity | Mostly clear bilingual updates | Polished bilingual storytelling, ties to metrics |

## Support & Feedback Plan
- Daily Slack check-ins with mentor rotation.
- Office hours with Product Experience Engineer during build segment.
- Loom video feedback for each team; follow-up peer critique session.
