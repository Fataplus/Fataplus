## Data Migration Tools

The Data Migration Tools provide a structured way to evolve your database schema over time, ensuring smooth transitions between versions.

### Key Features

- **Version-controlled migrations**: Track and manage database schema changes
- **Up/down migration methods**: Apply and rollback changes as needed
- **Migration state tracking**: Keep track of which migrations have been applied
- **Command-line interface**: Easy-to-use interface for creating and running migrations

### Use Cases

- Adding new fields to existing collections
- Creating new collections
- Modifying validation rules
- Data transformations and enrichment
- Fixing data inconsistencies

## Data Archiving System

The Data Archiving System helps you manage database growth by moving old or inactive data to separate storage, improving performance and reducing costs.

### Key Features

- **Configurable archiving rules**: Define what data to archive based on various conditions
- **Flexible retention policies**: Choose to delete or mark archived data
- **Restore capability**: Bring archived data back when needed
- **Scheduled archiving**: Automate the archiving process
- **Storage options**: Store archives locally or in cloud storage

### Use Cases

- Archiving old orders and transactions
- Moving inactive user data
- Storing historical analytics data
- Compliance with data retention policies
- Reducing database size and improving performance

## Data Validation Hooks

The Data Validation Hooks provide custom server-side validation beyond basic schema rules, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

### Key Features

- **Advanced validation rules**: Complex validation logic for all collections
- **Business rule enforcement**: Ensure data follows business requirements
- **Automatic data enrichment**: Add computed or default values
- **Event-based actions**: Trigger actions based on data changes
- **Security enhancements**: Prevent invalid or malicious data

### Use Cases

- Validating complex data formats
- Enforcing business rules
- Preventing invalid data states
- Triggering notifications and emails
- Implementing custom security checks

## Implementation Guide

To implement these advanced data management features, follow these steps:

### 1. Data Migration Tools

1. Navigate to the `data-migration` directory:
   ```
   cd scripts/data-migration
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install pocketbase
   ```

3. Create your first migration:
   ```
   node migration-manager.js
   ```
   Select `create` when prompted and enter a name for your migration.

4. Edit the migration file to implement your schema changes.

5. Run the migration:
   ```
   node migration-manager.js
   ```
   Select `run` when prompted and enter your PocketBase admin credentials.

### 2. Data Archiving System

1. Navigate to the `data-archiving` directory:
   ```
   cd scripts/data-archiving
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install pocketbase
   ```

3. Configure archiving rules by editing `archive-config.json`.

4. Run the archiver:
   ```
   node archiver.js
   ```
   Select `run` when prompted and enter your PocketBase admin credentials.

5. Set up a cron job to run the archiver automatically.

### 3. Data Validation Hooks

1. Copy the `validation-hooks.js` file to your PocketBase server's `pb_hooks` directory.

2. Restart your PocketBase server to load the hooks.

3. Test the validation hooks by creating and updating records.

4. Modify the hooks as needed to fit your specific requirements.

## Best Practices

1. **Test in development first**: Always test migrations, archiving, and validation hooks in a development environment before applying them to production.

2. **Backup your data**: Create backups before running migrations or archiving operations.

3. **Start small**: Begin with simple migrations and archiving rules, then gradually implement more complex ones.

4. **Monitor performance**: Keep an eye on database performance after implementing these features.

5. **Document changes**: Keep track of all schema changes and validation rules for future reference.

## Maintenance and Updates

After implementing these features, regularly:

1. **Review and update migrations**: As your application evolves, create new migrations for schema changes.

2. **Adjust archiving rules**: Modify archiving rules based on data growth patterns.

3. **Refine validation hooks**: Update validation rules to match changing business requirements.

4. **Monitor archived data**: Ensure archived data is properly stored and accessible when needed.

5. **Check migration state**: Verify that all migrations have been applied correctly.
