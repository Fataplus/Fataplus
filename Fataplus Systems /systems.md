# Transcription complète — "How I Build Systems (so my business runs without me)" par Deya

> if your business can't run without you  
> you have a job not a business i was

> business as a definition implies that

> their business right and everything  
> everything  
> Hey hey they were trying to mimic the  
> chaos tornado for you guys okay  
> so all the people are being managed by  
> the CEO every single task has to be  
> approved by the CEO everything has to  
> flow through you because essentially  
> instead of creating the business as a  
> separate entity you are saying you're  
> the system so the cost of not having  
> systems is about a million things long  
> number one the business only exists in  
> the business owner's brain and that is  
> the worst place to store a business  
> there's this great quote from David  
> Allen where he says "The brain is great  
> for having ideas not storing them."  
> Number two it takes way more mental  
> energy to accomplish a task because you  
> have to manually think about how it gets  
> done instead of just having a process  
> having a system that you can follow  
> every single time if every single time I  
> make a thumbnail I have to think okay  
> what's the first step again okay I have  
> to do this okay and then oh yeah and  
> then I can't forget that okay okay i  
> can't forget that okay that's chaos we  
> don't want that third thing is if you  
> don't have processes you don't have  
> systems you cannot delegate anything  
> properly which means you can't hire and  
> outsource which means you cannot scale  
> which means you are on your own forever  
> i know a lot of business owners do this  
> instead of creating systems and  
> processes they just think hiring is the  
> answer let me just hire people a bunch  
> of people really quick and because all  
> the processes live in their brain and  
> they don't know how to properly hand it  
> over to the people that they hire the  
> people that they hire then don't do as  
> good of a job as they want them to do  
> the fourth thing this drives me crazy  
> inconsistent output and quality and  
> potentially costly mistakes happen right  
> have you ever been to a cafe  
> have you ever been to a cafe where you  
> just know they do not have systems or  
> processes in place it drives me nuts  
> sometimes I go to the same cafe and one  
> day I'll order matcha and it will be  
> like sugared milk like there's no matcha  
> it doesn't there's not even a whiff of  
> greenness in the matcha and then another  
> day I'll go and the matcha will like  
> knock me out for seven business days  
> that shows me immediately there's no  
> process there's no training happening we  
> want when customers come to buy our  
> products or services that they know what  
> to expect now I go to a cafe where I see  
> them every time they make my matcha they  
> put the cup on a scale and then they  
> start doing the matcha and they're  
> weighing exactly how much matcha is in  
> the cup and that is why I go back to  
> them over and over and over again now  
> because I know every single time I'm  
> going to have a banging matcha so this  
> is essentially what we want ideally we  
> want to pull you out of the system so it  
> doesn't depend on you you can just look  
> at it from above but all of them will  
> operate on their own without your input  
> without everybody asking you a million  
> questions about is this correct or do  
> can you approve this or what about this  
> and is this okay and all this stuff okay  
> so we're going to have our big systems  
> our first layer of systems then we're  
> going to have our subsystems and then  
> we're going to have processes and that's  
> what we're talking about in this video  
> okay and the best news is once you have  
> this system this is when you can  
> perfectly start to delegate another  
> great quote from the book Work the  
> System is your task as a CEO is to  
> optimize one system after another not  
> carine through the day randomly taking  
> care of whatever problems erupt your job  
> is not to be a fire killer your job is  
> to prevent fires from happening in the  
> first place and if you're thinking "Oh  
> my gosh that's me i'm currently the  
> person that randomly goes through and  
> tries to fix everything you are not  
> alone that is the case for most business  
> owners out there and that is what we're  
> trying to solve so don't worry okay so  
> first let's even define the word system  
> because I feel like a lot of times  
> people talk about it but they don't  
> really define exactly what they think it  
> is and obviously lots of people have  
> different definitions but what I think  
> they are is a collection of repeatable  
> processes designed to produce consistent  
> results without starting from scratch  
> each time and to reach a specific goal  
> so let's break that down so let's say  
> the system of creating weekly YouTube  
> videos the repeatable processes within  
> that system are how you track video  
> ideas how you share files with your  
> video editor how you upload videos how  
> you do your intros how you script  
> certain parts of your videos the  
> consistent results we want there are  
> consistent professional optimized videos  
> right and the specific goal that this  
> system is pushing us towards is to grow  
> our channel and build a personal brand  
> on YouTube okay what about another  
> system a teeth system so the repeatable  
> processes within the system of your  
> teeth right how you brush your teeth do  
> you go left to right up or down how  
> often you brush your teeth how you floss  
> whether you floss um if you use those  
> little interd dental brushes that your  
> dentist always tells you to do but you  
> just really hate using them um whether  
> you book your dentist appointments those  
> are all little processes within the  
> system of teeth right the consistent  
> result we want is clean teeth and the  
> specific goal that this is achieving is  
> no cavities which is the biggest win of  
> all really so there are lots of  
> different types of systems right you can  
> have personal systems like for your  
> health like your morning routine could  
> be a system how your exercise routine is  
> a system how you meal prep is definitely  
> a system you could have money systems  
> like how you budget how you spend how  
> you invest you can also have business  
> systems right content creation how you  
> post to Instagram how you create content  
> or product fulfillment like how do you  
> fulfill your service actually step by  
> step how do you onboard clients step by  
> step how do you offboard clients step by  
> step how do you handle conflict with  
> your clients step by step so really and  
> this is something I love to say is that  
> everything is a system and once you have  
> that systems mindset everywhere you look  
> you're like everything's a system like  
> looking at my phone I'm like the the  
> process of creating my phone is such a  
> system they need to do it so step by  
> step otherwise everyone would get a  
> different phone another example I was  
> thinking about this non-stop when I was  
> looking at Taylor Swift's era store  
> collection of processes for outfits the  
> multiple outfit changes for preparing  
> outfits for the stage setup i mean if  
> you've looked at the stage setup I think  
> they have four replicas of that same  
> stage that they were like it took them  
> two weeks to set up and then like they  
> had to take it down then drive it to the  
> next city and then the second stage  
> would be setting up and then she would  
> perform on that one and then that one  
> would go like they had an entire  
> logistical system for how they got those  
> stages set up even just one process like  
> for example we just imagine she changes  
> outfits so fast they probably have some  
> sort of process for changing all these  
> like for example assistant A receives Q  
> and earpiece then assistant B arranges  
> the outfit at the quick change station  
> taylor enters the area assistants begin  
> removing outfit top down then they  
> remove the earpiece pack hands to audio  
> tag audio tech changes battery pack they  
> style helper step like there must be  
> that process the fact that 150 shows  
> almost all went off identically is  
> insane and really just shows the level  
> of the system that was working behind  
> the scenes and if you get this meme you  
> get this meme if you don't I'm sorry so  
> if it wasn't clear by now first you work  
> your system then your systems do the  
> work so systems that you might have in  
> your business might be things like  
> marketing right how do you do all the  
> marketing things so that people actually  
> see your products and services how do  
> you handle your team how do you handle  
> all the little bits and pieces to hiring  
> and training and onboarding product how  
> do you actually fulfill your product and  
> make sure that clients are happy right  
> and then you might have subsystems  
> within those systems so you might have  
> within marketing social media paid ads  
> affiliates within team you might have  
> subsystems like how you hire how you  
> handle payroll how you handle software  
> for managing the team and then within  
> product you might have subsystems like  
> your course and you have a community and  
> how you handle tech support or something  
> like that and then within those systems  
> you have your processes right for  
> example and I mean it might be way more  
> than this but for example how we film  
> and edit Instagram reels how we set up  
> Facebook ads how we edit weekly  
> newsletters within team you might have  
> processes like how we grant access to  
> team files how we pay contractors how we  
> conduct weekly meetings how we hire  
> people how we send them contracts how we  
> send them NDAs it's a million things  
> right and if you're like Da that's a lot  
> of stuff yeah you're right and guess  
> where all of that is right now it's in  
> your brain and if you're like yeah but  
> DEA then everything still flows through  
> me i have a solution for that at the end  
> of the video we still have to cover the  
> details first okay so the agenda here so  
> let's dive into actually creating the  
> system now so step one is we're going to  
> brain dump everything that you're  
> casually storing in your brain out this  
> does not need to have any rhyme or  
> reason to it i just want you to think of  
> everything essentially you do  
> recurringly in your business daily  
> weekly monthly and just write them all  
> out now I would recommend brain dumping  
> into a table or spreadsheet because of  
> all the steps that we're about to do  
> together i'm going to be doing it in a  
> notion table and yes there is a template  
> and yes you can have the template for  
> free but only if you do the pop quiz  
> that I'm linking down below i want to  
> make sure you're paying attention not  
> just downloading a bunch of free stuff  
> and not doing anything with it i only  
> want people who are serious about  
> creating systems to get this template  
> that is why there's a pop quiz now you  
> might be thinking "Okay Dia I brain  
> dumped as much as I could but I still  
> feel like there are things I'm  
> forgetting that aren't in here." That's  
> totally fine every time you come across  
> the task that's not in here just go into  
> the notion and then add it in and then  
> I'm just going to add quickly what  
> system it's a part of and the frequency  
> of the system so how often do I do it do  
> I do it every single week every single  
> day bi-weekly monthly quarterly just add  
> that in there all right the next thing  
> we're going to want to do is now score  
> things again there are a million tasks  
> that we do within our business a million  
> projects going on we can't be like "Okay  
> now they're all equally important tasks  
> and we're now going to have to create  
> processes for all of them at the same  
> time." So that's why we're going to  
> score and we're going to create  
> processes for the most important things  
> that you do in your business that are  
> the easiest to create processes and  
> systems out of essentially so this is  
> the formula that I came up with so let  
> me just walk you through it frequency is  
> basically how often you do it the more  
> often you do something the more  
> important it is for us to create a  
> process out of it the next thing that I  
> want you to score is annoyance on a  
> scale of 1 to five how annoying is this  
> thing to you one being like I'm totally  
> good i could do this a million times i'm  
> totally fine it's not annoying at all  
> five being I would rather go on the  
> stairmaster than do this task all right  
> the next thing is impact and by impact I  
> mean impact on your business goals so if  
> your business goal is to I don't know  
> hit six figures this year how important  
> is this task to getting you there and  
> this is also a good way to audit all the  
> things you're doing and be like okay if  
> I'm scoring something zero impact or one  
> impact why am I doing it the next thing  
> we're going to score is simplicity so  
> simplicity is just how simple is the  
> task how easy is it to give it to  
> somebody else how easy is it to create a  
> process out of that so for example the  
> process of how to create an invoice for  
> a customer in our business is very easy  
> right step one duplicate our invoice  
> template step two copy the customer  
> information into the invoice step three  
> make sure that the quantity is the right  
> amount step four send it to it's like  
> very step by step that's a very simple  
> process so for a task like how to send a  
> customer an invoice the simplicity might  
> be five because it's super simple a more  
> complicated process is for example how  
> we ideulate for YouTube videos that's  
> way more complicated anything that  
> involves more creativity more strategy  
> more like brainstorming thinking kind of  
> task is a lot more complicated to hand  
> off once you score those four things you  
> will get a delegation priority score  
> auto calculated your DPS and we want a  
> high DPS so if you are using my notion  
> template because you did the pop quiz  
> and I'm proud of you then all you have  
> to do is up here once you finish step  
> one go to step two and something fun  
> that I did if I do say so myself is I  
> made it so that when you select the  
> frequency like weekly daily bi-weekly or  
> whatever it automatically creates a  
> number for that instead so we can use it  
> in our formula so you don't even have to  
> fill in the frequency number all right  
> amazing so we've scored everything and  
> essentially what you'll already start  
> seeing populate is your delegation  
> priority score this is the magic  
> equation that I came up with but again  
> you can change it if you're like I want  
> to prioritize processes or systems in a  
> different way that's fine but  
> essentially what I have it is frequency  
> plus annoyance plus impact plus  
> simplicity of task divided by four so  
> the average essentially gives you a  
> delegation priority score and if you're  
> using the notion because you did the pop  
> quiz and you were a good student this  
> will automatically be calculated for you  
> which is very exciting and if we score  
> it descendingly then we will already  
> notice what we need to create processes  
> for first okay so it's time for a  
> roadblock mini audit situation now that  
> you have all the tasks listed out you  
> have all the scores I invite you to have  
> a little look at a few things if it's  
> low impact busy work potentially you can  
> delete it so I would just double check  
> maybe it has impact for something else  
> maybe it's like a long game thing you're  
> doing if that's the case that's totally  
> fine but if it's like low impact busy  
> work that someone's doing and it's not  
> really important this is an opportunity  
> to be like we can stop doing that if  
> there is a tool out there that can get a  
> task that you do regularly done you have  
> somebody manually taking the payment  
> processing customer info and typing it  
> into a CRM in Air Table there's a zap  
> for that zapier is amazing for that go  
> check out Zapier it will automatically  
> zap between two tools information next  
> one if it's impactful but super annoying  
> and someone else can do it like 80 to  
> 90% as well as you because the  
> simplicity is pretty high then this is a  
> great opportunity to document it which  
> we're going to talk about in a second  
> and delegate it okay so we've scored now  
> step three is owners and I love I love  
> this game i love this question so the  
> owners part of this is and if you're  
> using my notion all you have to do is  
> just go on over and click the step three  
> tab i mean if this is not a plug for  
> studying taking notes on my videos and  
> doing the pop quiz and getting the  
> notion because it's perfectly laid out  
> for you I don't know what is so go to  
> step three and at this stage what you're  
> going to do is you're going to put down  
> who the current owner of this task is  
> and the best part the ideal owner of  
> this task okay so the current owner if  
> you're currently alone in your business  
> the current owner it's all you right so  
> annoying now we're going to put in the  
> ideal owner okay and this is a really  
> good opportunity to look at what you  
> actually want to do in your business and  
> what you don't and I'm not saying that  
> if you put ideal owner someone else you  
> have to give that task up right away  
> this is just kind of like a romanticized  
> ideal perfect if you could wave a magic  
> wand who would be in charge of each of  
> these tasks and it's possible all of the  
> ideal owners aren't you i want you to  
> essentially dream big let yourself dream  
> for a second and just be like who is the  
> ideal owner and I feel like we don't ask  
> CEOs that enough of like if you didn't  
> have to do everything what would you  
> choose to do in your business this is  
> the opportunity to answer that question  
> and at this stage if you're like "Okay D  
> but I don't have any team members what  
> should I put an ideal owner?" This is my  
> favorite part because I feel like at  
> this stage you can start thinking about  
> who you might hire to fill some of these  
> things right so who would be the person  
> that could do this task for example I  
> have this task here check Slack  
> community and respond to all unread  
> questions and threads i feel like  
> somebody that could do that task that's  
> not currently on my team would be like a  
> program assistant a program manager a  
> customer support person maybe or like uh  
> an external coach I could hire into my  
> system to help students with their  
> questions and concerns so I might put  
> something like program assistant or  
> manager so now we finished dumping  
> everything we can think of scoring we've  
> put in the owners now we can start to  
> think about who that first hire might be  
> how we might outsource to them how we  
> might delegate to them and that is why  
> the next step is probably arguably the  
> most important one and that is to  
> document right before we delegate we  
> always want to document we don't want to  
> just hire a bunch of people on and  
> they're like "How do you do these things  
> in your business?" And we're like "I  
> don't know figure it out." So a quick  
> audit before we document i want you to  
> run through these things do you  
> currently already have a checklist that  
> you follow if yes that's a great place  
> to work off of also making templates for  
> anything repeatable customer emails  
> YouTube descriptions Instagram graphics  
> anything that you do and you're like "Oh  
> yeah this could easily be a template."  
> Like for example if you have a customer  
> support inbox it's very easy the next  
> time you send you get a frequently asked  
> question and you write a response just  
> copy that into a document and title it  
> frequently asked questions that  
> customers ask me and then put in the  
> question put in your response right and  
> then next time you can just copy that  
> and then make some changes and you don't  
> always have to start from scratch right  
> okay so making templates is really good  
> audit your tools are you using too many  
> tools i would say most business owners  
> are and next audit point for every step  
> that you are documenting ask why do you  
> really need it or is it just how you've  
> always done things all right step four  
> now we're getting to documenting and  
> again I'm not saying you have to  
> document every single task that's in  
> your system spreadsheet right now i'm  
> saying you should prioritize the top  
> ones right the ones that we can give  
> away first potentially so you can choose  
> your method here there are lots of  
> different things you can do a video  
> walkthrough which is my personal  
> favorite you can use something like Loom  
> or Vimeo any tool that allows you to  
> screen record your screen and your  
> microphone at the same time so you can  
> explain what you're doing you can do a  
> written step-by-step process or  
> checklist if you want or advance  
> sometimes I include this if the task is  
> like I said a little bit more complex i  
> might include something like a decision  
> tree like how I make a decision in this  
> process so for example like with video  
> ideas like which ideas do we pick to  
> create YouTube videos out of because we  
> ideulate so much i might create a  
> decision tree like has this been  
> validated by this or this have we done  
> this before recently this or this is it  
> related to this topic i might do  
> something like that if it's super  
> complicated my best tips before you  
> document is number one prep before you  
> start recording just like have a little  
> list of like things you definitely want  
> to cover and you don't want to forget  
> it's also always good to show an example  
> of how it's done and keep it as simple  
> as possible don't go off on rambling  
> tangents if they're not necessary i  
> really like using video to document  
> processes because I feel like then when  
> you give it to someone they can re-watch  
> it as often as they want that's so  
> different to showing someone how to do  
> something like via Zoom and there also a

> well so I feel like video is just the  
> best thing to start with and they can  
> watch it on 2x 1.5x so it's really  
> customizable to whatever this person

> in the notion right and looking at the  
> scoring I'm like "Oh these two tasks if  
> the ideal owner was somebody else and  
> the current owner was still me those are  
> the tasks I would prioritize giving to  
> someone else first." So this is what we  
> want right we want the systems the  
> subsystems the processes we want the  
> processes documented when we want to  
> figure out what might be the first  
> things we want to outsource for if you  
> notice that a bunch of tasks at the top

> assistant and you hire someone like  
> Sandy for virtual assistant you can just

> and filter by Sandy and she'll see all  
> the things that you want her to take  
> over and all the videos of exactly how

> the frequency of when they're done and  
> here's exactly a video of exactly how to

> That's life-changing that's  
> life-changing onboarding okay I'm sorry
