- Fine-grained permissions and roles (admin, seller, learner, delivery, mentor, etc.).
- GDPR compliance, data privacy, secure storage (Nextcloud, Paperless).
- Strong authentication (2FA).
- Backups, monitoring, action logging.
- Accessibility (WCAG), responsive design, inclusive UX (language, tech level, disabilities).

# Security Guidelines

## Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens with proper expiration
- Refresh token rotation
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Session management and timeout

## Input Validation
- Server-side validation for all inputs
- Zod schemas for type-safe validation
- XSS prevention with proper sanitization
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- File upload validation and scanning

## Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Data anonymization for analytics
- GDPR compliance for EU users

## API Security
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- API key management and rotation
- Request/response logging
- Input sanitization and validation
- Error handling without information leakage

## File Security
- Secure file upload handling
- Virus scanning for uploaded files
- Content type validation
- File size limitations
- Secure file storage and access

## Security Headers
```javascript
// Required security headers
{
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
  'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=63072000',
  'Content-Security-Policy': 'default-src \'self\'',
  'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin'
}
```

## Environment Variables
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use different secrets for each environment
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use secret management services
- Validate required environment variables at startup

## Third-Party Integrations
- Regular security audits of dependencies
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use trusted sources only
- Implement proper API key management
- Monitor third-party service status
