## 1. Module Vision

### Problem to Solve
Agritech innovators struggle to translate field insights and AI opportunities into production-ready digital experiences. Product squads juggle farmer research, CX strategy, UX/UI systems, and no-code/AI delivery without a unified playbook, causing stalled pilots, patchy handoffs, and slow learning cycles.

### Target Users
- Fataplus product strategists and UX designers leading agritech engagements
- External agritech founders and cooperatives seeking packaged design expertise
- Bootcamp cohorts practicing real-world agritech briefs

### Unique Value Proposition
Agri-AI Design Lab fuses ethnographic insight mining, AI concept framing, UX/UI and front-end prototyping, no-code acceleration, and change-readiness strategy into a cohesive module. It ships venture-grade product design packets—research narratives, Figma systems, AI prompts, and Bubble/FlutterFlow build briefs—that spotlight Fataplus’ startup-level velocity and agritech intelligence.

### Inspirational Benchmarks
- IDEO design sprints adapted to agriculture contexts
- Google Design Sprint toolkit for rapid prototyping
- FAO digital agriculture frameworks emphasizing farmer adoption

## 4. Workflow Ecosystem

### Core Workflows
1. **engagement-kickoff** (standard): Intake objectives, stakeholders, timelines → outputs discovery canvas, success metrics, agent tasking.
2. **insight-to-concept** (complex): Ingest research artifacts → synthesize insights → map AI opportunities → rank by impact/feasibility.
3. **concept-to-prototype** (complex): Translate chosen opportunity into UX flows, UI direction, no-code/AI build strategy, and prototype checklist.

### Feature Workflows
- **agri-persona-forge** (standard): Generate farmer/partner personas with pain/gain grids.
- **ai-service-blueprint** (standard): Produce service blueprint combining digital touchpoints and field operations.
- **data-readiness-audit** (standard): Audit available datasets, gaps, governance for AI use cases.
- **prototype-storyboard** (simple): Craft narrative storyboard linking user goal, AI assist, and outcomes.
- **impact-pitch-kit** (standard): Build investor/client pitch deck summarizing problem, solution, metrics.
- **nocode-mvp-sprint** (standard): Generate Bubble/Glide/FlutterFlow sprint plan with component mapping and API checklist.
- **cx-journey-map** (simple): Produce end-to-end service blueprint including support, success, and growth loops.

### Utility Workflows
- **asset-ingestor** (simple): Normalize research notes, CSVs, transcripts into structured knowledge.
- **playbook-exporter** (simple): Compile outputs into branded report, Notion/Markdown bundle, and developer handoff packet.
- **bootcamp-mode-toggle** (simple): Adjust prompts/deliverables for educational cohorts vs client delivery.

## 5. User Scenarios

1. **Agency Engagement Lead** initiates `engagement-kickoff`, aligns stakeholders, then runs `insight-to-concept`. Agents generate AI opportunity shortlist; `concept-to-prototype` delivers UX storyboard and UI guidance, enabling a polished proposal within days.
2. **Early-stage Agritech Founder** uploads pilot feedback via `asset-ingestor`; the Field Ethnographer surfaces adoption blockers, AI Solution Crafter recommends automation loops, Product Experience Engineer converts the winning concept into a Bubble blueprint, and the CX/DX Strategist crafts a phased rollout plan.
3. **Fataplus Bootcamp Cohort** activates `bootcamp-mode-toggle`, receives guided prompts, Product Experience Engineer outputs Figma-ready briefs plus no-code tasks, Bootcamp Mentor returns rubric-based feedback and success metrics.

---

## 6. Technical Planning

- **Data Needs:** Research transcripts (PDF/CSV/JSON), persona docs, usage analytics, dataset inventories, product strategy briefs, component libraries, CX analytics.
- **Integrations:** Figma API (spec export), Notion/Confluence, Google Drive, BMAD knowledge graph, Bubble/FlutterFlow/Glide connectors, optional OpenAI/Claude or Replit for AI-assisted UI code.
- **Storage:** Intermediate outputs cached in `.bmad/docs`; playbooks stored in `docs/` with versioning.
- **Complexity:** Standard-to-complex (due to multi-agent coordination and external tool hooks). Modular workflows allow staged rollout.

---

## 7. Success Metrics

- 80% of client briefs converted into actionable playbooks within 5 working days.
- ≥70% adoption of recommended prototypes in pilot projects and ≥50% progression to clickable no-code MVPs.
- Bootcamp cohorts report ≥4/5 satisfaction on realism and guidance.
- Tangible SDG impact indicators referenced in ≥60% of final reports.

**Quality Standards:**
- UX outputs align with Fataplus design system tokens and front-end code guidelines.
- AI recommendations include feasibility, ethical guardrails, and ops-readiness checks.
- Reports deliver bilingual (FR/EN) executive summary, CX/DX playbook, and developer handoff.

---

## 8. Development Roadmap

- **Phase 1 – MVP:** Studio Orchestrator + Field Ethnographer + AI Solution Crafter; workflows `engagement-kickoff`, `insight-to-concept`, `asset-ingestor`, `playbook-exporter`.
- **Phase 2 – Enhancement:** Add Product Experience Engineer, CX/DX Strategist; release `concept-to-prototype`, `agri-persona-forge`, `ai-service-blueprint`, `impact-pitch-kit`, `nocode-mvp-sprint`.
- **Phase 3 – Polish:** Bootcamp Mentor optional agent, `bootcamp-mode-toggle`, Figma/Notion/no-code connectors, live design-token sync, easter eggs.

---

## 9. Creative Flourishes

- Easter egg: hidden command `grow-a-meme` generating morale-boosting agritech memes.
- Agent banter referencing Malagasy proverbs about farming to humanize sessions.
- Optional “field-day” mode simulating a farm visit narrative during workshops.

## 10. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Category | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unreliable research inputs degrade insights | Technical | Enforce `asset-ingestor` validation, prompt user for missing metadata |
| Scope creep across client vs bootcamp modes | Scope | Guardrails via `bootcamp-mode-toggle`, preset deliverable templates |
| AI recommendations misaligned with infrastructure reality | Usability | `data-readiness-audit` mandatory before concept sign-off |
| Multi-language outputs inconsistent | Quality | Adopt bilingual template with translation QA checklist |

## 11. Final Brief & Next Actions

Agri-AI Design Lab is ready for create-module workflow ingestion. Primary focus: deliver market-ready agritech playbooks, reinforce Fataplus positioning, and support 2026 Figma bootcamp cohorts. Recommended next steps:

1. Validate MVP scope with agency leadership and bootcamp team.
2. Prioritize connector development (Figma, Notion, Bubble/FlutterFlow) in Phase 2.
3. Schedule pilot run on an upcoming agritech engagement to collect metrics.

_This brief can be fed directly into the BMAD `create-module` workflow._
