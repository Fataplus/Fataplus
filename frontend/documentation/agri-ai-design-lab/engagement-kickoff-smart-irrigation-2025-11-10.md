# Engagement Kickoff Canvas

**Project:** Smart Irrigation Companion
**Client / Partner:** FOFIFA Agritech Lab
**Date:** 2025-11-10
**Facilitator:** Miora (Studio Orchestrator)

## 1. Mission & Context
- Problem statement: Smallholder farmers lack timely irrigation guidance, causing water waste and yield loss.
- Target users / beneficiaries: 800 rice farmers in Alaotra-Mangoro; regional agronomists.
- Desired outcomes: Deploy bilingual mobile/web experience that predicts watering windows, syncs with cooperative dashboards, and proves +15% yield lift in pilot.
- Constraints & assumptions: Spotty connectivity, limited sensors, budget capped at €35k, delivery window 14 weeks, compliance with local data privacy norms.

## 2. Stakeholder Map
| Stakeholder | Role | Expectations | Cadence / Channel |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dr. Ranaivo (Program Lead) | Sponsor | Visibility on milestones, impact metrics | Weekly email summary + monthly review call |
| Lova (Cooperative Champion) | Field liaison | Training materials, offline access | WhatsApp group; on-site sessions bi-weekly |
| FOFIFA Data Team | Data providers | Clear API specs, governance alignment | Slack connect; data clinic Fridays |
| Fataplus Design Squad | Delivery | Alignment on sprint scope, support | Daily async standup in Linear |
| Bootcamp Cohort Beta | Trainee testers | Structured exercises, mentor feedback | Weekly studio lab |

## 3. Success Metrics
- Primary metrics: 15% yield increase, 20% water savings, 70% weekly active users during pilot.
- Supporting indicators: NPS ≥ 35, onboarding completion < 15 minutes, cohort lesson satisfaction ≥ 4.2/5.
- Validation checkpoints: Week 2 concept review, Week 6 prototype field test, Week 12 MVP launch, Week 14 impact readout.

## 4. Workstream Ownership
| Agent / Team | Responsibilities | Immediate Next Step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Studio Orchestrator | Coordination, playbook exports | Schedule sprint zero + confirm tool stack |
| Field Ethnographer | Research synthesis, persona updates | Digest 12 interview transcripts by 2025-11-14 |
| AI Solution Crafter | Use-case prioritization, data audit | Map AI opportunities + launch readiness audit |
| Product Experience Engineer | UX/UI + no-code build | Draft navigation concept and component inventory |
| CX/DX Strategist | Adoption & KPI framework | Outline training path + KPI dashboard blueprint |
| Bootcamp Mentor | Education alignment | Adapt sprint into cohort exercise brief |

## 5. Risks & Open Questions
- Risks: Data gaps for evapotranspiration models; device affordability; limited irrigation infrastructure.
- Open questions: Which cooperatives own solar pumps? What languages beyond French/Malagasy needed? How to sync with MAEP reporting?
- Mitigations: Partner with MeteoMada for weather API, design SMS fallbacks, engage microfinance partner for equipment leasing.

## 6. Notes
Kickoff confirmed for 2025-11-12 with on-site + remote participants. Draft MOU awaiting legal review.
